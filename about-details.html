                    <p>
                        My fascination with technology started at a young age when I built my first website using HTML and CSS. Over the years, I've honed my skills in programming, web development, and AI/ML. My academic journey, from earning a Bachelor's in Computer Applications (BCA) to pursuing an MCA, has been filled with hands-on projects, internships, and a relentless drive to learn and innovate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've worked on diverse projects, from AI-powered chatbots to full-stack web applications, and contributed to open-source communities like Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC). Each experience has shaped my understanding of technology and reinforced my passion for creating impactful solutions.
